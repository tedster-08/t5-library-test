  <strong>Troop History</strong> <br />The Boy Scouts of America was
  incorporated in 1910. Troop 5 of Maplewood, New Jersey was chartered ten years
  later, in 1920. Over the years, Troop 5 has distinguished itself as one of the
  finest Boy Scout Troops in our area. The Troop has seen over one hundred
  Scouts achieve the rank of Eagle Scout.

  <strong>Troop 5 Today </strong> <br />
  Troop 5 is proud to be one of the largest Scouts BSA units in the Lenape Trail
  District of Northern New Jersey Council. We have an active Scout membership of
  about 50 boys, ranging in age from 11 to 17. We currently have five patrols,
  each made up of scouts of various ages, ranks and experience. Please explore
  this website and contact us below if you have questions or are interested in
  being part of Troop 5!
